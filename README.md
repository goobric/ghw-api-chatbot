## a simple guess my number chatbot

Here's how the chat bot works:

* It greets the user and explains the rules of the game.
* It generates a random number between 1 and 100.
* It asks the user to guess the number and stores the guess in a variable.
* It enters a loop where it compares the user's guess to the random number.
* If the guess is too low, it tells the user to guess higher.
* If the guess is too high, it tells the user to guess lower.
* It asks the user to take another guess and increments the number of tries.
* If the user guesses the number correctly, it congratulates the user and displays the number of tries it took.

You can run this code in your Python interpreter or save it as a .py file and run it from the command line. Have fun playing the game!
